Dungeons is a simple text-based javascript game about choice. Choose your path wisely. Will you live long enough to escape? Or will you die trying...

***INSTRUCTIONS***

Github copilot was used to create scoring along with making the UI function.
UI made using a tutorial by Web Dev Simplified on youtube [tutorial link](https://youtu.be/R1S_NhKkvGA?si=PHD0-wVvPqPV_3nK)
